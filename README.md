# MemScent

**Turn your favorite memories into custom fragrance recipes.**

We all carry vivid, smell-linked memories: Grandma’s warm kitchen, the fresh tang of summer rain, the smoky warmth of a beach bonfire.  
MemScent turns those mental snapshots into real-world fragrance recipes by:

- **Listening to Your Memory**  
  You type in any memory—“Grandma’s cookies” or “first day of college”—and hit **Generate Scent**.

- **Thinking in Vector Space**  
  Under the hood, we send your memory text to an AI “embedding” model that transforms words into numbers, capturing their meaning.

- **Blending an Oil Trio**  
  A Random Forest regressor, trained on past user feedback, maps that embedding to three essential oils (for prototyping purposes—e.g. Coffee, Vanilla, Bergamot) and their exact percentages to recreate the emotion of your memory.

- **Learning and Improving**  
  You give a 👍/👎. Every day, the system retrains itself on the latest feedback so that it gets better at matching blends to memories.

- **Serving It Fast**  
  I cache memory→recipe lookups in Upstash Redis-KV so repeat requests are instantaneous and API calls are minimized.

- **Turning Data Into Aroma (ongoing)**  
  An ESP32-powered diffuser can pull your custom recipe over Wi-Fi and drive peristaltic pumps or MOSFET-controlled valves to dispense the exact blend in your home, office, or retail space.

## Project Overview

MemScent has two main components:

1. **Cloud AI Server** (`/cloud`)  
   - **FastAPI** + **scikit-learn**  
   - Trains a multi-output RandomForest on OpenAI embeddings  
   - Exposes `/predict` to map a user memory → a 3-oil blend  

2. **Web Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)  
   - **Next.js** + **React** + **TypeScript**  
   - User enters a memory, clicks **Generate Scent**, sees a blend  
   - Feedback (👍/👎) stored to retrain the model daily  

3. **Caching**  
   - **Upstash Redis-KV** caches memory→recipe lookups for instant repeats  

4. **Hosting & CI/CD**  
   - Deployed on **Vercel** with automatic Git-triggered builds  
   - Environment variables and secrets managed in the Vercel dashboard  

5. **Embedded Diffuser & Edge Control (ongoing)**  
   - **ESP32** microcontroller running **PlatformIO** code  
   - Controls peristaltic pumps or MOSFET-driven valves for each oil line  
   - Wi-Fi endpoint to fetch recipe and dispense the blend automatically

   - **Mount** the Pi Camera V2 over the diffuser fill station to capture fill levels or user interactions  
   - **Connect** each Load Cell + HX711 board to the Pi’s I²C pins (SDA/SCL) or spare GPIOs for clock/data  
   - **Place** each oil bottle on its load-cell platform for weight-based, closed-loop dispensing  
   - **Continuously read** weight via HX711 and adjust pump durations in firmware

- **Pi** runs the AI & web dashboard, reads camera & weight sensors  
- **ESP32** fetches recipe & drives oil pumps in real time  
- **Bi-directional**: Pi can monitor dispense progress via HX711 and camera, then adjust pump durations
